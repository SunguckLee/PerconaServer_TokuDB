Warnings:
Note	####	Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is extremely insecure.
Note	####	Storing MySQL user name or password information in the master info repository is not secure and is therefore not recommended. Please consider using the USER and PASSWORD connection options for START SLAVE; see the 'START SLAVE Syntax' in the MySQL Manual for more information.
Warnings:
Note	1753	slave_transaction_retries is not supported in multi-threaded slave mode. In the event of a transient failure, the slave will not retry the transaction and will stop.
