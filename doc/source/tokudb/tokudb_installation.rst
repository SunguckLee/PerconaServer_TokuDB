 TokuDB Installation
=====================

|Percona Server| is technically compatible with the separately available TokuDB storage engine package. TokuDB engine is not packaged with any |Percona Server| 5.6 download. The TokuDB engine must be separately downloaded and then enabled as a plug-in component. Â This package can be installed alongside with standard |Percona Server| 5.6 releases starting with :rn:`5.6.19-67.0` and does not require any specially adapted version of |Percona Server|.

The `TokuDB <http://www.tokutek.com/products/tokudb-for-mysql/>`_ storage engine is a scalable, ACID and MVCC compliant storage engine that provides indexing-based query improvements, offers online schema modifications, and reduces slave lag for both hard disk drives and flash memory. This storage engine is specifically designed for high performance on write-intensive workloads which is achieved with Fractal Tree indexing. To learn more about Fractal Tree indexing, you can visit the following `Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index>`_.

Only the `Percona supplied <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.6/LATEST/>`_ TokuDB engine should be used with |Percona Server| 5.6. A TokuDB engine downloaded from other sources may not be compatible.

The TokuDB engine is released by Tokutek Inc. under a modified form of the GNU GPL v2 license. You can view a copy of the modified license `here <https://github.com/Tokutek/ft-index/blob/master/README-TOKUDB>`_.

TokuDB Hot Backup is a proprietary, commercial product available for download only from `Tokutek.com <http://www.tokutek.com/products/mysql-download-for-mysql-mariadb/>`_. It is not available for download from Percona.

TokuDB is currently supported only for 64-bit Linux distributions. It is not available for Debian 6.0 (squeeze) and Ubuntu 10.04 (lucid) due to conflicts with the gcc version required by TokuDB.


Prerequisites 
=============

``libjemalloc`` library
-----------------------

TokuDB storage engine requires ``libjemalloc`` library 3.3.0 or greater. If the version in the distribution repository is lower than that you can use one from :ref:`Percona Software Repositories <installation>` or download it from somewhere else.

If the ``libjemalloc`` wasn't installed and enabled before it will be automatically installed when installing the TokuDB storage engine package by using the ``apt`` or ``yum`` package manager, but |Percona Server| instance should be restarted for ``libjemalloc`` to be loaded. This way ``libjemalloc`` will be loaded with ``LD_PRELOAD``. You can also enable ``libjemalloc`` by specifying :variable:`malloc-lib` variable in the ``[mysqld_safe]`` section of the :file:`my.cnf` file: :: 

  [mysqld_safe]
  malloc-lib= /path/to/jemalloc


Transparent huge pages
----------------------

TokuDB won't be able to start if the transparent huge pages are enabled. `Transparent huge pages <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Performance_Tuning_Guide/s-memory-transhuge.html>`_ is feature available in the newer kernel versions. You can check if the Transparent huge pages are enabled with: ::
  
  $ cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

   [always] madvise never

If transparent huge pages are enabled and you try to start the TokuDB engine you'll get the following message in you :file:`error.log`: ::

 Transparent huge pages are enabled, according to /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
 Transparent huge pages are enabled, according to /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

You can `disable <http://www.oracle-base.com/articles/linux/configuring-huge-pages-for-oracle-on-linux-64.php#disabling-transparent-hugepages>`_ transparent huge pages permanently by passing ``transparent_hugepage=never`` to the kernel in your bootloader (**NOTE**: For this change to take an effect you'll need to reboot your server).

You can disable the transparent huge pages by running the following command as root (**NOTE**: Setting this will last only until the server is rebooted): 
  
.. code-block:: bash

  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
  echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag

Installation
============

TokuDB storage engine for |Percona Server| is currently available in our :ref:`apt <apt_repo>` and :ref:`yum <yum_repo>` repositories.

You can install the |Percona Server| with TokuDB engine by using the apt/yum commands:

.. code-block:: bash

 [root@centos ~]# yum install Percona-Server-tokudb-56.x86_64

or

.. code-block:: bash

 root@wheezy:~# apt-get install percona-server-tokudb-5.6


Enabling the TokuDB Storage Engine
==================================

This storage engine requires manual installation if there is a root password already set up during the new installation or upgrade. 

.. code-block:: mysql

 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_file_map SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_fractal_tree_info SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_fractal_tree_block_map SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_trx SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_locks SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';
 INSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_lock_waits SONAME 'ha_tokudb.so';

After the engine has been installed it should be present in the engines list. To check if the engine has been correctly installed and active: 

.. code-block:: mysql

 mysql> SHOW ENGINES;
 ...
 | TokuDB | YES | Tokutek TokuDB Storage Engine with Fractal Tree(tm) Technology | YES | YES | YES |
 ...

To check if all the TokuDB plugins have been installed correctly you should run:

.. code-block:: mysql

 mysql> SHOW PLUGINS;
 ...
 | TokuDB                        | ACTIVE   | STORAGE ENGINE     | ha_tokudb.so | GPL     |
