.. _innodb_kill_idle_trx:

========================
 Kill Idle Transactions
========================

This feature limits the age of idle |XtraDB| transactions. If a transaction is idle for more seconds than the threshold specified, it will be killed. This prevents users from blocking purge by mistake.
