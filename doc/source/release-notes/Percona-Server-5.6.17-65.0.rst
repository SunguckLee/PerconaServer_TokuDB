 |Percona Server| 5.6.17-65.0 
==============================

Percona is glad to announce the release of |Percona Server| 5.6.17-65.0 on May 6th, 2014 (Downloads are available `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.6/Percona-Server-5.6.17-65.0/>`_ and from the :doc:`Percona Software Repositories </installation>`).

Based on `MySQL 5.6.17 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-17.html>`_, including all the bug fixes in it, |Percona Server| 5.6.17-65.0 is the current GA release in the |Percona Server| 5.6 series. All of |Percona|'s software is open-source and free, all the details of the release can be found in the `5.6.17-65.0 milestone at Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/percona-server/+milestone/5.6.17-65.0>`_.

New Features
============

 |Percona Server| now supports :ref:`scalability_metrics_plugin`.

 |Percona Server| now supports :ref:`audit_log_plugin`.

 |Percona Server| parser and query optimizer now support :ref:`tokudb_multiple_clustering_keys` when TokuDB engine is used. 

 Storage engine handler interface has been extended with new calls to notify the storage engine of imminent table or index scan. The calls are used by TokuDB to improve performance of these operations.

 |Percona Server| packages are now available for *Ubuntu* 14.04.

Bugs Fixed
==========

 |Percona Server| couldn't be built with *Bison* 3.0. Bug fixed :bug:`1262439`,upstream :mysqlbug:`71250`.

 Fixed the inadequate background LRU flushing for write workloads with |InnoDB| compression that could lead to lower performance. Bug fixed :bug:`1295268`.

 |Percona Server| debug packages were not built for the previous releases. Bug fixed :bug:`1298352`.

 Queries that no longer exceed :variable:`long_query_time` were written to the slow query log if they matched the previous :variable:`long_query_time` value when :variable:`slow_query_log_use_global_control` variable was set to ``all``. Bug fixed :bug:`1016991`.

 When writing audit plugins it was not possible to get notifications for general-log events without enabling the general-log. Bug fixed :bug:`1182535` (upstream :mysqlbug:`60782`).

 ``mysqld_safe`` did not correctly parse :variable:`flush_caches` and :variable:`numa_interleave` options. Bug fixed :bug:`1231110`.

 :ref:`threadpool` would handle a new client connection without notifying Audit Plugin. Bug fixed :bug:`1282008`.

 Fixed a performance issue in extending tablespaces if running under ``fusionIO`` with :ref:`atomic writes <atomic_fio>` enabled. Bug fixed :bug:`1286114` (*Jan Lindstr√∂m*).

 Previous implementation of the :variable:`log_slow_rate_type` set to ``query`` with :variable:`log_slow_rate_limit` feature would log every nth query deterministically instead of each query having a 1/n probability to get logged. Fixed by randomly selecting the queries to be logged instead of logging every nth query. Bug fixed :bug:`1287650`.

 |Percona Server| source files were referencing *Maatkit* instead of |Percona Toolkit|. Bug fixed :bug:`1174779`.

 Maximum allowed value for :variable:`log_slow_rate_limit` was ``ULONG_MAX`` (ie. either ``4294967295`` or ``18446744073709551615``, depending on the platform). As it was unreasonable to configure the slow log for every four billionth session/query, new maximum allowed value is set to ``1000``. Bug fixed :bug:`1290714`.

Other bugs fixed :bug:`1295523`, :bug:`1299688` (upstream :mysqlbug:`72163`) and :bug:`1272732`.
