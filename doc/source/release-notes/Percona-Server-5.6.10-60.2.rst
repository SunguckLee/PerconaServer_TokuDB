New Features
=============

 :ref:`expanded_innodb_fast_index_creation` has been ported from |Percona Server| 5.5

 Ported the :ref:`threadpool` patch from |MariaDB|. This feature enables the server to keep the top performance even with the increased number of client connections.

 :ref:`innodb_corrupt_table_action_page` has been ported from |Percona Server| 5.5

Bug Fixes
==========

 Fixed the upstream :mysqlbug:`68116` that caused the server crash with assertion error when |InnoDB| monitor with verbose lock info was used under heavy load. This bug is affecting only ``-debug`` builds. Bug fixed :bug:`1100178` (*Laurynas Biveinis*).

 Fixed the extra ``libtinfo`` package dependency in |Percona Server| tarballs. Bug fixed :bug:`1153950` (*Ignacio Nin*).
